    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> This is the very best, Easy Healthy Baked Salmon! Made with lemon and garlic for incredible flavor and baked in the oven for flaky tenderness, this tasty salmon recipe is the answer to busy nights and special occasions alike! <em>Prep Time: 15 minutes. Cook Time: 18 minutes. Total Time: 33 minutes.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salmon Fillets - look for fresh salmon fillets that are nice and pink and moist. Alternatively, purchase frozen fillets that are vacuum sealed with no freezer burn.</li>
            <li>Olive Oil - I use extra virgin, but any kind will work. You can also substitute vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Salt - Kosher salt works great; I also love Himalayan pink salt.</li>
            <li>Cracked Black Pepper - I tend to go overboard but remember to use a little pepper at first and taste before adding more.</li>
            <li>Minced Garlic - Minced garlic in oil purchased at the store is great or you can mince your own.</li>
            <li>Italian Herb Seasoning Blend (or Herbs de Provence) - Any well-known brand will do or make your own.</li>
            <li>Lemon - A medium-size lemon is fine here or purchase a larger one if you love the tangy tartness of extra lemon.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and grease a large baking pan. Arrange the salmon fillets on the baking sheet and season generously with salt and pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p>Stir together the olive oil, garlic, herbs, and juice of 1/2 of the lemon. Spoon this sauce over salmon fillets, being sure to rub all over the tops and sides of the salmon so it has no dry spots. Thinly slice the remaining 1/2 of the lemon and top each piece of salmon with a slice of lemon.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake the salmon in the oven for 15-18 minutes or until the salmon is opaque and flaky when pulled apart with a fork. You can broil the last 1-2 minutes if desired.</p></li>
            <li><p>Garnish with fresh thyme or parsley if desired and serve.</p></li>
        </ol>
